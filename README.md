## First Course - Python for Data Science

This introduction to Python has kickstarted learning of Python for data science, as well as programming in general. This beginner-friendly Python course has took me from zero to programming in Python in a matter of hours.

Upon its completion, I am able to write my own Python scripts and perform basic hands-on data analysis using their Jupyter-based lab environment.

Received a certificate on successful completion of the course (Course Code: PY0101EN)
